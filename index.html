title: Thorvaldsdalur terrain run
subtitle: The oldest terrain run in Iceland, first held in 1994
---
Thorvaldsdalur terrain run is the oldest terrain run in Iceland. It took place for the first time
in 1994 and every year since. The run is held on the first Saturday in July annually in the 
Þorvaldsdalur valley in northern Iceland (about 20 km north of Akureyri town).

Þorvaldsdalur valley is peculiar in the sense that it is open in both directions, in the south 
to Hörgárdalur valley and to the north to Árskógsströnd by the coast of Eyjafjörður fjord. The run starts 
close to the old bridge on Tunguá in Hörgárdalur between the farms of Fornhagi and Dagverðartunga see: [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FQQuv2TwtuyEahzh9).
